🎯 PromoGroup Landing Page

This is a responsive landing page project created as part of my first independent practice with CSS Grid layout.
The goal was to build a multi-section landing page using modern CSS techniques and semantic HTML.

🧠 Overview

This page includes:

Hero section with title and call-to-action button

Statistic counters

Team gallery

Contact form

Footer
All layouts are built primarily using CSS Grid and some Flexbox utilities.

💡 What I Learned

During this project I practiced:

Setting up multi-column CSS Grid layouts

Nesting grids and aligning items

Using custom properties for colors and typography

Building layouts without frameworks

Debugging layout issues in Chrome DevTools

📌 Next Steps (future improvements)

Make the layout fully responsive on smaller screens

Add smooth scroll animations

Improve accessibility (ARIA labels, focus states)

🧡 This was my first real project with CSS Grid — not perfect but deeply educational.
